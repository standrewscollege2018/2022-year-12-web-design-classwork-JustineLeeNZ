      <h1>About Staccato Cafe</h1>
      <p>The café is open every morning from 7:30am for staff and parents.
        If you are new to the school, the cafe is upstairs in the Year 4 to 8
        building and overlooks the tennis courts and Secondary School turf.
        The café provides the opportunity for parents to meet other parents
        and to form connections and communication links, and to develop
        friendships that may last well beyond your children leaving
        the College in Year 13.</p>
